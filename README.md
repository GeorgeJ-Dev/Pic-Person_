# Pac-Man Clone (VB.NET)

This is a custom-built Pac-Man clone developed in Visual Basic .NET. The game features object-oriented design, user interaction, and pathfinding. Ghosts use a hybrid of Breadth-First Search and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to pursue the player intelligently across a 2D grid-based maze.

## Key Features
- Object-oriented structure using custom classes for characters, tiles, and game logic
- Custom pathfinding for ghosts (hybrid BFS + Dijkstra)
- Collision detection and state-based game mechanics (scatter, chase, frightened)
- Player score tracking and simple UI
- Different modes player can play
- Fully playable game built in Visual Studio

## Technologies
- Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET)
  
## How to Run
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
2. Build and run the project
3. Use arrow keys or WASD to control Pac-Man and avoid the ghosts!
